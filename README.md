Steps for the Backend(NodeJs):

1. open cmd and run "npm install".  # this will install all the modules needed.
2. if there is a error which says that port is being used by another application , go to index.js and change the PORT number.
3. there is nothing on the homepage , so a blank page will be opened on localhost:5000/ but the console will print hello.
4. The routes for the application are in /disease, -> for the submit button. /user/api -> for the user login and signup. /imageToText/api -> for the image porcessing.
5. The database used is the cloud version , so no need of installing anything.
6. Do not change anything in the config folder or in the .env file. The application may crash.
7. if any doubt or query is to be solved , comment on the repo or send an email.
